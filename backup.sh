# This is a simple backup script using borg. It's supposed to serve as a
# starting point and to be adjusted to your system.
#
# Important steps:
#  - define a host "backup" in root's .ssh/config
#  - You can override variables from main() as well as the pre_backup() and post_backup() functions in
#    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/backup-sh-conf.sh or /etc/backup-sh-conf.sh
#  - As root run `borg init -v --encryption=keyfile backup:borg-$(hostname)`
#  - If you want, increase the max_segment_size in
#    ssh://backup/borg-$HOSTNAME/config from the default 5MiB
